/*
 *Kodiak O'Masta, [TEAMMATES]
 *Created for CptS 122
 *Created 3-28-25
 *
 *An implementation of the game of Clue™ (or Cluedo™ if your weird)
 *
 *This program is dedicated to my (Kodiak's) dad, who in 19XX was working towards a degree in computer science. The
 *final project for the class he was taking at the time was to program a game of Clue™. Of course, since it was "Ye
 *Olden Times" he had no fancy languages to do it in, and instead was required to do it entirely in assembly (the
 *horror!). He was able to finish the project, but left with some less than positive feelings about the game. Of course,
 *that would not be the end of it, as his (now) ex-wife was also working towards the same degree and was a year behind
 *him. Now, she was not nearly as good as my dad and so after a full semester of him helper her, she somehow convinced
 *him to do the final project for her. He now, once again, had to program Clue™ in assembly, except this time he had to
 *do it in a completely different way to avoid plagiarizing himself. The sum total of these experiences had left him
 *with a deep disdain for Clue™ that has lasted to this day, and has become a running gag in my family. As such, I felt
 *that there could be no more appropriate choice for what to code for this final project, and as such this code is
 *dedicated to his struggles with this game.

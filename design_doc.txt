This file contains a basic outline of how the code will function to serve as a reference for those working on it.
Nothing in this document is fixed, static, or unchangeable by anyone working on this project.

UI:
The UI will have two parts, the main play area which will represent the board and all the information usually on the
board in the physical game, and a separate window which will have a notepad which the player can keep track of their
information on. The button for making the final guess will be on the notepad window while the one for making an
information gathering guess will be in the main window.

Data Structures:
The layout of the rooms will be stored as a tree data structure will all adjacent rooms being linked together.
